2. Parameters:
	In feature_transformer.py:
		- In function all_file_to_text():
			current_label is set = -1 because the level of the folder in the folder-tree is quite specific.
	In model.py:
		- In function backpropagation():
			rate is set = 1. This is the learning rate, can be adjusted if you want.
		- In function neu_net():
			epochs is set = 1000. The more epochs, the more accurate but slower.
		- In function main():
			sizes = [len(tfidf_vect.vocabulary_), 1024, 256, 128, 2]. These are the units on the layers. Just define these, don't need to define the number of layers.
			The first element should be the dimension of a vector, the last element should be the number of output classes.
